### API Contract

**Base URL**: Set via `VITE_API_BASE` environment variable

**Endpoints**:

1. `GET /api/issues` - Fetch all issues
   - Returns: Array of issue objects

2. `POST /api/issues` - Create a new issue
   - Request body:
   ```json
   {
     "title": "string",
     "category": "Roads & Infrastructure|Water & Sanitation|Waste Management|Safety & Security|Electricity & Lighting|Health & Environment|Public Services",
     "description": "string",
     "reporterName": "string",
     "location": {
       "county": "string",
       "ward": "string",
       "address": "string",
       "coordinates": [longitude, latitude]
     },
     "status": "New|In Progress|Resolved",

- **Accent**: White and gray neutrals
- **Font**: System fonts (Inter/Poppins fallback)

## Key Features Explanation

### Location Detection
Users can click "Detect" to automatically populate latitude/longitude using the browser's geolocation API.

### Map Integration
- Default center: Nairobi, Kenya
- Markers show issue details in popups
- Clicking an issue in the list focuses the map on that marker

### Filters
- Category filter: All, Roads & Infrastructure, Water & Sanitation, Waste Management, Safety & Security, Electricity & Lighting, Health & Environment, Public Services
- County dropdown: Sample Kenyan counties included
- Status filter: All, New, In Progress, Resolved

### Accessibility
- Modal focus trapping
- ARIA labels on interactive elements
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader friendly

## Development Notes

1. The backend is **not included** in this repository. You need to set up a separate MERN backend.
2. Image upload is stubbed - real Cloudinary integration can be added to the backend.
3. The app uses mock data until connected to a real backend.

## Browser Support

- Chrome (latest)
- Firefox (latest)
- Safari (latest)
- Edge (latest)
